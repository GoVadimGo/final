# Words like first, second and third are referred to as ordinal numbers. In this exercise,
# you will write a function that takes an integer as its only parameter and returns a
# string containing the appropriate English ordinal number as its only result. Your
# function must handle the integers between 1 and 12 (inclusive). It should return an
# empty string if a value outside of this range is provided as a parameter. Include a
# main program that demonstrates your function by displaying each integer from 1 to
# 12 and its ordinal number. Your main program should only run when your ﬁle has
# not been imported into another program.
